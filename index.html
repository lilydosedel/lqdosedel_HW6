    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>My name is Lily Dosedel, and I am passionate about using my creativity to make others look at the world differently. 
        Whether it's visualizing data to convey new insights or cooking up one of my signature Instagram carousel posts, I love to challenge the norm and find new ways to connect others. 
        I will soon graduate with a BBA in Marketing and Business Analytics & Information Systems from the University of Iowa, which perfectly blends the artistic and analytical sides of my brain. 
        When I'm not studying in the BizHub, I'm (hopefully) traveling the world or trying a new restaurant.
